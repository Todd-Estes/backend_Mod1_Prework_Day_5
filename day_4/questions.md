## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?\
A method executes a prescribed function, with the use of attached arguments.

1. Create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.\
```
def hello
      p "Sam I am."
end

1. Create a method named `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.\
```
def hello_someone(name)
      p "#{name} I am."
end


1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?\
```
hello_someone("Todd")

1. What questions do you have about methods in Ruby?\
No real questions...everything seems straight-foward so far!
