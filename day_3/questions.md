## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.\
Basically, they equate to true or false statements, and are used in branching. If a statement
is true or false, it will be ignored, or something will be executed, based on the statement's truth.\
A few examples:\
```
A == B
A <= B
A >= B

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

Catch and print a user error

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?\
```
if x = y
    puts statement here
end

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?\
-You would use elsif/else statements.

1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:
```
if a < b
    p statement #1 here
elsif a > b
    p statement #2 here
else
    p statement #3 here
end

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?\
When comparing two variables' values, or when creating an attribute for a class.
