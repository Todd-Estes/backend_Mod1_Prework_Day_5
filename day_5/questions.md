## Day 5 Questions

1. What is a Hash, and how is it different from an Array?\
-Hashes are composed of values, which hold other values. They are not ordered.\
-Arrays are values that are indexed in a set numerical order.

1. In the space below, create a Hash stored to a variable named `pet_store`.  This hash should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.\
`pet_store = {dog food: 50, cat food: 30, chew toys: 100, dog collars: 60}`

1. Given the following `states = {"CO" => "Colorado", "IA" => "Iowa", "OK" => "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?\
`states["IA"]`

1. With the same hash above, how would we get all the keys?  How about all the values?\
`states.keys`\
`states.values`

1. What is another example of when we might use a hash?  In your example, why is a hash better than an array?

Keeping track of birthdays in a kindergarten classroom. By using a hash, a child's birthday is associated with their name, making it easier to search and find. With an array, you would only have the birthday, but not the associated child's name.

1. What questions do you still have about hashes?

No questions, seems simple so far.
